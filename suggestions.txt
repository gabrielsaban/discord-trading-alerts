Here are several additional feature suggestions that would significantly enhance your trading alerts bot:
Alert Delivery Preferences
Let users choose how they receive alerts: channel alerts, DMs, or a dedicated alerts channel
This personalizes the experience based on how public/private users want their trading signals
Multi-Indicator Confirmation
Assign higher priority to alerts confirmed by multiple indicators
Example: RSI oversold + bullish engulfing pattern = stronger signal
Helps filter higher-quality trading opportunities
Scheduled Quiet Hours
Allow users to set times when they don't want to receive alerts
Particularly useful for traders in different time zones or with specific trading hours
Can be implemented per user or per symbol/interval
Alert Statistics Dashboard
Track the "success rate" of different alert types
Show what percentage of alerts led to price movement in the expected direction
Helps users focus on the most reliable signals for their trading style
Backtest Command
Add a /backtest command to test alert performance on historical data
Let users see how the bot's alerts would have performed on past price action
Great for building trust in the system
Market Regime Detection
Adapt alert sensitivity based on overall market conditions
Reduce false signals during highly volatile periods
Identify trending vs. ranging markets and adjust indicator thresholds
Performance Tracking
Allow users to mark alerts as "good" or "bad" signals with reactions
Use this feedback to improve future alert suggestions
Creates a continuously improving system
Cross-Timeframe Confluence
Highlight when multiple timeframes show similar signals
E.g., "RSI oversold on both 1h and 4h timeframes"
These tend to be stronger, more reliable signals
Custom Alert Combinations
Let users define their own multi-indicator setups
Example: "Alert me when RSI < 30 AND volume is 2x average"
Enables more sophisticated trading strategies
Price Target Projections
For pattern-based alerts, include potential price targets
Use ATR or historical pattern performance to estimate reasonable targets
Helps with exit planning
Alert Categories/Tags
Categorize alerts as "trend continuation," "reversal," "breakout," etc.
Let users filter which types they want to receive
Makes the system more flexible for different trading styles
Indicator Visualization
Include small chart images with alerts showing the indicator that triggered
Helps users quickly validate the signal visually
Could be optional to keep messages compact
Trading Journal Integration
Allow one-click saving of alerts to a simple trading journal
Track which alerts users acted on and their outcomes
Great for performance review and strategy improvement
Conditional Alerting
Set up "if this, then that" alert logic
Example: "Only alert RSI oversold if price is above 200 EMA"
Reduces false signals in counter-trend scenarios
These features build on your existing strong foundation and would take your bot to the next level in terms of user experience, signal quality, and learning capabilities. They're all realistic to implement with your current architecture and would provide substantial value to traders.
