# üí∏ Discord Crypto Trading Alerts Bot

A live Discord bot that tracks crypto pairs using real-time Binance data and notifies users of key technical indicator signals ‚Äî like RSI oversold, MACD crossovers, or EMA breakouts. Clean design, scalable alerts, and easy setup.

  - EMA crossovers (e.g. 9 EMA > 21 EMA)
  - Bollinger Band breakouts
  - Volume spikes
- ‚è∞ **Scheduled scans** (e.g. every 10 minutes)
- üß† Custom **watchlists** per user
- ‚úÖ Discord notifications via embeds or DMs

## üßä Smart Cooling System

The bot uses an advanced alert cooling system to prevent alert spam while ensuring you don't miss important signals:

## Signal Strength Prioritization
Strong signals can override cooldowns when they're significantly more important:
- Extreme indicator readings (e.g., RSI below 20, ADX above 40)
- Higher timeframe signals get priority
- Signals with high strength can break through even if cooldown period hasn't fully elapsed

1. **ATR-Based Dynamic Cooldowns**
   - 5m: 20 min base cooldown (¬±5 min based on 30-min ATR)
   - 15m: 1h base cooldown (¬±15 min based on 1h ATR)
   - 1h: 2h base cooldown (¬±30 min based on 4h ATR)
   - 4h: 24h base cooldown (fixed)

2. **Market Volatility Adjustments**
   - ATR percentile mapping: Top 25% ‚Üí +25% cooldown, Bottom 25% ‚Üí -25% cooldown
   - High-volatility session handling: +10% cooldown on 5m and 15m during London/NY overlap

3. **Enhanced Override Logic**
   - 4h/1d signals bypass all lower-tf cooldowns, then enter their own 24h duplicate-block cooldown
   - Extreme readings override active cooldowns on same timeframe (RSI < 20 or > 80, ADX > 40)
   - Medium signals can override shorter timeframe cooldowns if strength metric exceeds threshold

4. **Timeframe-Specific Alert Filtering**
   - Short Timeframes (1m, 3m, 5m): Limited to RSI and Volume alerts only - these indicators are most reliable at short intervals
   - Medium Timeframes (15m, 30m, 1h): Includes RSI, Volume, MACD, EMA, Bollinger Bands, and ADX alerts
   - Long Timeframes (4h, 1d, etc.): All indicators including Pattern Recognition, which is most reliable on higher timeframes
   - Controlled via feature flag: `ENABLE_TIMEFRAME_FILTERING`

5. **Interval-Specific Cooldowns**
   - Each timeframe maintains its own separate cooldown tracking
   - An alert on the 5m timeframe won't block the same alert type on the 1h timeframe
   - Allows for monitoring the same coin across multiple timeframes without missing signals
   - Particularly useful for scalping vs. swing trading on the same pair

## ‚öôÔ∏è Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `/watch BTCUSDT` | Start tracking a pair |
| `/unwatch BTCUSDT` | Stop tracking |
| `/list` | Show all your tracked pairs |
| `/settings` | Adjust alert thresholds |

## üìÖ Roadmap

- [x] Make all command responses ephemeral
- [x] Timeframe-specific alert types - limit short timeframes (1m, 5m) to only useful indicators like RSI and volume
- [x] Interval-specific cooldowns - separate cooldown tracking per interval so alerts on different timeframes don't block each other
- [X] Enhanced alert targeting - mention all users watching a particular symbol/interval instead of duplicating messages
- [ ] Remove any batch summary reference
- [ ] `/monitor` command to display permanent embeds with live crypto pair prices and current indicator statuses
- [ ] Config centralization - move all thresholds, periods, jitter %, etc. into a central YAML/JSON config for runtime tweaks
- [ ] Optional price change alerts

- [ ] Backtesting framework - analyze historical data to dynamically optimize default indicator thresholds for maximum profitability and signal quality
- [ ] Premium tier with custom threshold alerts - allow paid users to set personalized indicator thresholds delivered via DM
- [ ] Web dashboard (Flask/FastAPI)
- [ ] Telegram, email version/integrations
- [ ] Stocks integration (`yfinance`)
